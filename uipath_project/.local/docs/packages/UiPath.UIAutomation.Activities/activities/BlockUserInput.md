## How to create a new Block User Input

uip rpa get-default-activity-xaml --activity-class-name UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Activities.NBlockUserInput
```
## Notes

- No mandatory parent scope is required for this activity.
- Use the `BlockType` property to control whether keyboard, mouse, or both input types are blocked.
- Configure `KeyModifiers` and `Keys` to define a key combination that allows the user to manually unblock input.
- When `DisableUnblock` is set to true, input remains blocked until an explicit **Unblock User Input** activity is executed.
- The `Allow3rdPartyApps` option controls whether input from other automation tools or third-party applications is also blocked.
