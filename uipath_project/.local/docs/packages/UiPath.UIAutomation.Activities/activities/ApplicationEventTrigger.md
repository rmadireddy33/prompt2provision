## Properties

### Input

| Name | Display Name | Kind | Type | Required | Default | Placeholder | Description |
|------|-------------|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `Target` | Target | Property | [`TargetAnchorable`](common/Target.md#targetanchorable) |  |  |  | The UI element to perform the action on. |
| `MatchSync` | Match sync | Property | `bool` |  | `false` |  | Indicates whether the matching of the target element selector is done synchronously or asynchronously. |
| `Selectors` | Selectors | InArgument | `IEnumerable<string>` |  |  |  | Optional collection of selectors to monitor for the indicated event; these selectors will be monitored alongside the indicated target. |

### Configuration

| Name | Display Name | Kind | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|------|-------------|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `IncludeChildren` | Include children | InArgument | `bool` |  |  | When selected, the children of the specified UI element are also monitored. By default, this check box is selected. |
| `SchedulingMode` | Scheduling mode | Property | [`TriggerActionSchedulingMode`](common/TriggerActionSchedulingMode.md) |  |  | It specifies how to execute the actions when a trigger is fired. Sequential: actions are executed one after another; Concurrent: actions execution can overlap; OneTime: executes one action and exits monitoring. For Sequential and Concurrent modes the monitoring continues until either the user stops the execution or a Break activity is met. |

## How to create a new Application Event Trigger

uip rpa get-default-activity-xaml --activity-class-name UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Activities.NNativeEventTrigger
```
## Notes

- This activity requires a parent `Use Application/Browser` scope.
- Use this activity to set up triggers based on native application events on a specified UI element.
- The `Match sync` property controls whether target element matching occurs synchronously or asynchronously.
- Additional selectors can be provided via the `Selectors` property to monitor multiple elements for the same event.
- The `Scheduling mode` controls how multiple trigger firings are handled (sequentially, concurrently, or one-time).
