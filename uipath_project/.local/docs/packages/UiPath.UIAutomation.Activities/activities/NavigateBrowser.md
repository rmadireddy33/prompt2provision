## Notes

- This activity must be placed inside a **Use Application/Browser** (`NApplicationCard`) scope.
- The `Action` property supports browser navigation operations such as Go Back, Go Forward, Close, Refresh, and Home.
- This activity does not require a target element since it operates at the browser level.
- All properties with `browsable: false` (Target, InUiElement, OutUiElement, HealingAgentBehavior) are hidden from the designer and excluded from this documentation.
