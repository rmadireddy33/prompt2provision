# NChildInteractionMode

`UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Enums.NChildInteractionMode`

The interaction method used by activities placed inside a **Use Application/Browser** scope. Adds the `SameAsCard` option (compared to [`NInteractionMode`](NInteractionMode.md)) so child activities can inherit the parent card's setting.

## Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `NChildInteractionMode.SameAsCard` | Use the InputMode setting from the parent Application/Browser activity. |
| `NChildInteractionMode.HardwareEvents` | Acts like a normal user using "hardware" such as a mouse or a keyboard to interact with applications. Hardware events are triggered which are sent to the operating system. This option emulates human behavior 100%. However some events might be lost. |
