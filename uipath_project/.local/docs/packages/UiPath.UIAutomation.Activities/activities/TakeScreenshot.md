### NFileNameMode

`UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Enums.NFileNameMode`

How the output file name is generated when a file with the same name already exists.

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `NFileNameMode.None` | The file name will be exactly as specified, and in case another file with the same name already exists, it will be overwritten. |
| `NFileNameMode.Index` | If one or multiple files that match the pattern `Filename (XX)` already exist, a new file is created with name `Filename (N+1)`, where `N` is the max index from the existing files. |
| `NFileNameMode.DateTime` | If one file with the specified name already exists, a new file is created with name `Filename YYYY.MM.DD at HH.MM.SS`. If a file with that name already exists, an index is appended (e.g. `Filename YYYY.MM.DD at HH:MM:SS (1)`). |

## How to create a new Take Screenshot

To generate the default XAML for this activity, run the following command:

```bash
uip rpa get-default-activity-xaml --activity-class-name UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Activities.NTakeScreenshot
```
## Notes

- This activity must be placed inside a **Use Application/Browser** (`NApplicationCard`) scope.
- Screenshots can be saved as a file (using `FileName` and `SavedTo`) or as an in-memory image (using `OutImage`).
- The `FileNameMode` property controls behavior when a file with the same name already exists.
- The `DelayAfter` property is hidden in this activity.
