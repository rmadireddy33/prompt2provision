# Check App State

`UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Activities.NCheckState`

Ensures the automated app is in a specific state, by verifying if a UI element exists or not. A set of user-defined actions are executed based on the detected state.

**Package:** `UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities`
**Category:** UI Automation.Application

## How to create a new Check App State

To generate the default XAML for this activity, run the following command:

```bash
uip rpa get-default-activity-xaml --activity-class-name UiPath.UIAutomationNext.Activities.NCheckState
```
## Notes

- This activity does not require a mandatory parent scope and can be used standalone or inside a **Use Application/Browser** (`NApplicationCard`) scope.
- Contains two execution branches: "Target appears" and "Target does not appear". Activities placed in each branch are executed based on the detected state.
- The default timeout is 5 seconds (different from most other activities which default to 30 seconds).
- Use `CheckVisibility` to also verify that the element is visually visible on screen, not just present in the DOM.
- The `ContinueOnError` and `DelayAfter` properties are hidden in this activity.
