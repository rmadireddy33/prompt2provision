Fix or improve a UiPath selector using the UiAutomation CLI and runtime data.

The skill operates on a target definition file in `$FOLDER`. Callers pass either a `$DEF_FILE` directly or raw `--window-selector`/`--partial-selector` flags; the skill synthesizes the def file in the latter case. Supports both full (window + partial) and window-only modes -- when `PartialSelector` is empty, only the window selector is improved.

**IMPORTANT: Use forward slashes in ALL paths.** Backslash paths break the Read tool.

## CLI

```
CLI="uip rpa uia"
```

If `$PROJECT_DIR` is set, append it: `CLI="uip rpa uia --project-dir \"$PROJECT_DIR\""`. All subsequent `"$CLI" ...` commands will automatically include it.

## Input Parsing

Extract from `$ARGUMENTS`:

- First positional argument or `--definition` -> `$DEF_FILE`. Path to the definition JSON file containing `WindowSelector`, `PartialSelector`, etc.
- `--window-selector <sel>` -> `$WINDOW_SELECTOR`. Raw window selector string. Form 1 only -- ignored if `$DEF_FILE` is provided.
- `--partial-selector <sel>` -> `$PARTIAL_SELECTOR`. Raw partial selector string. Form 1 only -- ignored if `$DEF_FILE` is provided.
- `--activity-type <type>` -> `$ACTIVITY_TYPE` (default: `Click`). Pass through to the CLI, which validates the value. Only relevant when synthesizing a def file from `--window-selector`/`--partial-selector`; def-file input carries its own `ActivityType`.
- `--folder <path>` -> `$WORK_FOLDER`. Folder for snapshot artifacts (tree JSONs, screenshot, instruction files).
- `--mode recover` or `--mode improve` -> `$MODE`. If not specified, infer from phrasing:
  - **recover** (default): "fix", "broken", "stopped working", "element not found", "recover", "failed"
  - **improve**: "improve", "robust", "optimize", "strengthen", "harden", "resilient"
  - If unclear, default to `recover`.
- `--quiet` -> `$QUIET=true` (default: `false`). Suppress all output -- just write files. Used when this skill is called as a sub-step by another skill.
- `--project-dir <path>` -> `$PROJECT_DIR` (optional). UiPath project directory. Included in all CLI commands via the `$CLI` variable.

If `$WORK_FOLDER` is not provided and `$DEF_FILE` is provided, use the directory containing `$DEF_FILE`. If neither is provided, ask the user.

### Resolve the definition file

**If `$DEF_FILE` is provided** -- use as-is.

**Else if `$WINDOW_SELECTOR` is provided** -- synthesize a def file in `$WORK_FOLDER` from the flags and set `$DEF_FILE=$WORK_FOLDER/Target_Definition.json`:

```bash
echo '{}' > "$WORK_FOLDER/Target_Definition.json"
"$CLI" target-anchorable update-definition \
  --definition-file-path "$WORK_FOLDER/Target_Definition.json" \
  --window-selector "$WINDOW_SELECTOR" \
  --activity-type "$ACTIVITY_TYPE" \
  ${PARTIAL_SELECTOR:+--partial-selector "$PARTIAL_SELECTOR"}
```

**Reject partial-only input:** if `$PARTIAL_SELECTOR` is provided without `$WINDOW_SELECTOR`, stop with an error -- the CLI needs at least the window selector to produce useful instructions.

**Neither def file nor selector flags** -- ask the user for one or the other.

### Refresh snapshot artifacts

Run `snapshot capture` to fill any gaps and refresh the highlighted screenshot when the app is live:

```bash
"$CLI" snapshot capture --folder-path "$WORK_FOLDER" --definition-file-path "$DEF_FILE"
```

`snapshot capture` skips tree extractions for files that already exist, so pre-staged offline folders are preserved. A live app adds a fresh `ApplicationScreenshot.jpg` with the target highlighted; an unreachable app just means no updated screenshot.

## IMPROVE-1: Get Instructions

Run the CLI to generate instruction files. The CLI writes three separate files to `$WORK_FOLDER`:
- `selector-system-prompt.md` -- the system prompt with rules and constraints
- `selector-user-message.md` -- the user message with the task, selectors, and DOM data
- `selector-schema-config.md` -- the JSON schema for the expected output

```bash
"$CLI" selector-intelligence get-instructions --folder-path "$WORK_FOLDER" --definition-file-path "$DEF_FILE" --mode $MODE
```

## IMPROVE-2: Read Instructions and Generate Selectors

**Use ONLY the Read tool and Write tool for this step. Do NOT use Bash, Python, or any other tool to parse, process, or extract content from the instruction files.**

1. Read the three instruction files using the Read tool (use `offset` and `limit` for large files):
   - `$WORK_FOLDER/selector-system-prompt.md` -- the rules and constraints to follow
   - `$WORK_FOLDER/selector-user-message.md` -- the task to execute (can be large due to DOM JSON)
   - `$WORK_FOLDER/selector-schema-config.md` -- the output schema
2. Read `$WORK_FOLDER/ApplicationScreenshot.jpg` for visual context (skip if it doesn't exist).
3. Execute the task from `selector-user-message.md` following the rules from `selector-system-prompt.md`. Write the JSON result (conforming to the schema in `selector-schema-config.md`) to `$WORK_FOLDER/improve-selector-output.json` using the Write tool.

## IMPROVE-3: Validate and Retry Loop

This step runs a validate->fix loop. **Max 3 iterations total.**

Set `$ATTEMPT = 1`.

### Validate

```bash
"$CLI" selector-intelligence validate --folder-path "$WORK_FOLDER" --definition-file-path "$DEF_FILE" --improve-selector-response-file-path "$WORK_FOLDER/improve-selector-output.json" --mode $MODE > "$WORK_FOLDER/validation-result.txt" 2>&1
```

Read `$WORK_FOLDER/validation-result.txt`.

### At least one valid -> done

Pick the selector with the highest FinalScore. Read the top-level `reasoning` field from `$WORK_FOLDER/improve-selector-output.json` to extract the root cause and strategy.

Update `$DEF_FILE`: read it first, preserve all existing fields. Set `"WindowSelector"` to the winning candidate's WindowSelector. If the winning candidate has an EditablePartialSelector, also set `"PartialSelector"` to it.

Jump to **Output**.

### None valid -> fix and retry

If `$ATTEMPT >= 3`: save the last validation result and jump to **Output** with the errors.

Otherwise:

1. Read `$WORK_FOLDER/validation-result.txt` carefully -- focus on the `ToolingFeedback` for each candidate to understand what went wrong (schema violations, invalid attributes, missing required fields, etc.).
2. Re-read `$WORK_FOLDER/improve-selector-output.json` to see what you generated.
3. Fix the generation based on the feedback: adjust the selectors to address the specific issues flagged. Write the corrected result to `$WORK_FOLDER/improve-selector-output.json` (overwrite).
4. Increment `$ATTEMPT` and go back to **Validate**.

## Output

**If `$QUIET` is `true`: The calling skill will continue with its next step.**

**If no valid selectors after 3 attempts:** present the last validation errors and stop improving attempts.

**Otherwise:** read `$DEF_FILE` to get the selectors. Present using this template (fixed selector LAST so it's visible in terminal):

### Selector <Fixed|Improved>  (Score: <FinalScore>/1.0)

> **Root cause:** <one sentence -- why the original selector broke>  <- recover mode only

> **Strategy:** <one sentence -- what makes the selector more robust>

> <If there's a score penalty, add one line explaining it's a structural UI property, not fixable by selector changes.>

**Original:**
```
<WindowSelector from definition file>
<each tag on its own line from PartialSelector>  <- omit if empty
```

**Window:**
```xml
<WindowSelector from validation result>
```

**Target:**  <- omit entire block if no EditablePartialSelector
```xml
<each tag on its own line from EditablePartialSelector>
```

````

- If the window selector didn't change from the original, omit it from both **Original:** and **Window:** sections.
- Keep it tight -- no full analysis dump. The detailed candidate analysis is already saved in the output files if needed.
- Do NOT show all 3 selectors. Do NOT retry for score penalties -- they're often structural properties of the UI that can't be fixed by adding tags.
