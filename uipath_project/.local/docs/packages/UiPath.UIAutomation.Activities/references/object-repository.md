# Object Repository

The Object Repository is a centralized repository for UI Automation screens and targets. It allows you to define and manage reusable UI descriptors (applications, screens, and elements) that can be referenced across your automation project.

**IMPORTANT: All interaction with the Object Repository must be performed via the CLI. The CLI entry point is `uip rpa uia object-repository` (e.g., `uip rpa uia object-repository get-screens`). See [cli-reference.md](cli-reference.md) for the complete CLI reference.**

## Key Concepts

### Application

An **Application** is a top-level container of screens. It represents the application being automated (e.g., a desktop app or a web browser page).

### Screen

A **Screen** represents an application screen. It contains a **TargetApp** which is used by scope activities such as `Use Application/Browser`. Screens are created from definition files that contain window selectors.

### Element

An **Element** represents a UI element on a screen. It contains a **TargetAnchorable** which is used by activities that need a target (e.g., `Click`, `Type Into`). Elements are created from definition files and are always associated with a parent screen.
